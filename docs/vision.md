# AppBricks – Vision

## Purpose
AppBricks project exists to make the creation of high-quality SwiftUI applications
repeatable, predictable, and fast – without sacrificing code quality,
maintainability, or developer understanding.

## Problem Statement
Modern app development is fast, but quality often degrades as each new app
reinvents architecture, infrastructure, and patterns.
AI accelerates code generation, but without a strong foundation it amplifies
inconsistency and technical debt.

AppBricks addresses this by providing a simple approch and a set of
composable building blocks that form a stable baseline for application.

Other platform provde similer 

## Vision
AppBricks aims to become a construction kit for SwiftUI applications,
where most apps are assembled rather than invented from scratch.

Developers should be able to focus on domain-specific problems while relying
on AppBricks for structure, quality, and consistency.

The "bricks" are developed in packages and injected in the core.

## Principles
- Quality over speed, but optimized for both
- Explicit over implicit behavior
- Composition over inheritance
- Testability as a first-class concern
- Clear boundaries between features and infrastructure
- Refactoring-friendly by design

## Scope
AppBricks is not a low-code platform and not a visual app builder.
It does not attempt to hide Swift or SwiftUI, but to structure their use.

AppBricks targets iOS first, with macOS support following naturally through
shared architecture and SwiftUI abstractions.

## Success Criteria
- New apps can be bootstrapped in hours, not days
- Architectural decisions remain consistent across projects
- Code generated or written with AI integrates cleanly into the system
- Long-term maintenance cost is reduced, not increased

## Long-Term Direction
In the long term, AppBricks may support higher-level app specifications,
automation, and tooling – but only on top of a proven, understandable core.
